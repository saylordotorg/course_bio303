**Unit 9: Motor Systems** <span id="9"></span> 
*We will now focus on motor systems. Much of our motor control takes
place through nerve-to-muscle signaling in the form of the neuromuscular
junction. You will learn that fine motor control and movement
modulation *– *though involuntary *– *require a great deal of nervous
input and output. You will also learn about the autonomic nervous
system, which controls many of our internal organs. This unit will
encompass both aspects of voluntary and involuntary motor control,
examining the systems and major mechanisms of movement.  *

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 16.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.1: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.2: 3.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.3: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.4: 4 hours

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   compare and contrast voluntary motor control, involuntary motor
    control, and the systems which regulate motor control;
-   explain lower motor neuron syndrome, upper motor neuron syndrome,
    and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;
-   explain the significance of decussation to motor neuron control;
-   compare and contrast the tracts which control upper motor neuron
    control;
-   compare and contrast the brain regions and tracts which are
    responsible for movement modulation; and
-   define the parts of the visceral motor control system and the tracts
    and receptors responsible for visceral motor control.
