**Unit 5: Neural Development** <span id="5"></span> 
**The nervous system, elaborate and complicated as it is, developed from
a single cell. This unit will cover the major concepts behind the
remarkable process of neural development. This unit’s information draws
heavily from the developmental biology course; if you are interested in
development, you should consider enrolling in that course as well. *  
  
 *You will learn that the growth process begins with neurulation and
neural tube formation and continues along a very fast path. It involves
a huge number of different types of cells and signals but we will cover
only those that have the most significant impact. Finally, we will
examine some birth defects that arise from improper development.**

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   explain the steps of gastrulation and neurulation;
-   explain how retinoic acid, growth factors, BMPs, and sonic hedgehog
    function to properly form the nervous system;
-   explain the general organization of the spinal cord, and the
    internal organization of the spinal cord; and
-   explain the causes and impacts of the altered development syndromes,
    Fragile X, hydrocephalus, autism, and Down’s Syndrome.

     Instructions: Read the entire webpage, and carefully view the
    images. Vitamin A is essential for the normal development of
    vertebrate embryos. If a developing embryo is deprived of vitamin A,
    the fetus, particularly the fetal brain, will not form correctly.
    Vitamin A itself is not directly responsible for the regulation of
    embryonic development. Vitamin A is metabolized to form RETINOIC
    ACID. Retinoic acid is essential in determining position along the
    embryonic anterior/posterior axis and the dorsal/ventral axis. The
    biological importance of retinoic acid has long been known, as major
    developmental abnormalities follow retinoic acid deprivation or
    exposure to excess retinoic acid. Some of these abnormalities
    resemble congenital birth defects that are relatively common in
    humans, including spina bifida and cleft palate.
