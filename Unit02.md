**Unit 2: Electrical Signaling** <span id="2"></span> 
*Our nervous system is amazingly responsive and powerful when reacting
to information about the body and its environment. If you touch a very
hot object, you instantly feel pain and automatically withdraw your
hand. The entire process, from heat sensation to the coordination of
motor function, happens within milliseconds*–*in other words, faster
than you can consciously think! This type of speed requires a very fast
and strong signaling method known as electrical signaling. This unit
explains this process in detail, teaching you how signaling is generated
and how it is propagated. You will also learn about a few devastating
diseases that occur when the process is compromised.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 9.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.4: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.5: 2 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   explain what a resting membrane potential and the ionic basis of
    electric potential are;
-   define a voltage-dependent current, and describe how
    sodium-potassium channels function in a voltage-dependent current;
-   define threshold, depolarization, refractory periods, and the
    all-or-none principle;
-   compare and contrast channels and transporters;
-   compare and contrast voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels;
-   explain how signals are propagated; and
-   describe three diseases of electrical signaling.

    non-specific,depending on their purpose for the body. For example,
    potassium channels used in action potential are highly specific to
    potassium and will not allow other ions to sneak through. This is
    largely due to the thermodynamic properties of the channel, which is
    in turn based on the structure of the channel itself. Be sure to
    understand this connection, noting how structure determines
    specificity!
