**Unit 6: Neuroanatomy** <span id="6"></span> 
*During development, various levels of organization are built into cells
in order to create structure and order. This unit will introduce the
most important structures in neurobiology, from the cerebral cortex to
the base of the spinal cord. Neuroanatomy can be broken down into the
“cephalons” (i.e. the top of the head is the telecephalon). As many of
these structures are functionally unique but visually similar, it can be
difficult to distinguish one from another. Thus, while you are learning
these structures, it is important to reference a visual aid that will
show you the location and shape.*

     Instructions: Scroll down and read the fourth paragraph. Then,
    click the hyperlink to Figure 12.3. The <span>pretectum</span> (or
    pretectal area) is a region of neurons found between the thalamus
    and midbrain. The pretectum primarily controls the pupillary light
    reflex. The <span>pupillary light reflex </span>is controls the
    diameter of the pupil in response to the intensity of light that
    falls on the retina of the eye. The pupillary light reflex is
    important in adaptation to various levels of darkness and light.
    More intense light causes the pupil to become smaller (allowing less
    light in), and less intense light causes the pupil to become larger
    (allowing more light in). Thus, the pupillary light reflex regulates
    the intensity of light entering the eye.    
      
     The pretectum receives sensory information from the retinal
    ganglion cells in both eyes. After receiving information, it
    projects to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and the ciliary ganglion,
    which regulate the size of the pupil by controlling the pupillary
    sphincter muscle and the pupillary dilator muscle, respectively.

**6.3.2 Cerebral Peduncles** <span id="6.3.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: The University of Texas’s *Neuroscience Online*: Dr.
    James Knierim’s “Ch 2: Spinal Reflexes and Descending Motor
    Pathways”**
    Link: The University of Texas’s *Neuroscience Online*: Dr. James
    Knierim’s [“Ch 2: Spinal Reflexes and Descending Motor
    Pathways”](http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s3/chapter02.html)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Scroll to the section entitled: “2.2 Descending Motor
    Pathways” and read as far as “Rubrospinal tract.” You can stop
    there.   
      
     The cerebral peduncles are three sets of paired bundles of the
    hindbrain *(superior, middle,* and *inferior),* which carry body
    movement information from the cerebrum to the brainstem and spinal
    cord. By definition, a “peduncle” is a stem- or stalk-like structure
    of nerve tracts that connect various regions of the brain.  
      
     The cerebral peduncles can be divided into anterior section, the
    crus cerebri,and a posterior section, the tegmentum. The crus
    cerebri and tegmentumare separated by the substantia nigra.  
      
     The corticospinal tract runs through the cerebral peduncles. The
    corticospinal tract is a collection of axons that travel between the
    cerebral cortex and the spinal cord, which is involved with discrete
    voluntary skilled movements, particularly in the hands and fingers.
    For example, when the cerebrum instructs your hand to reach behind
    your back to grab a long stick, your corticospinal tract refines
    that instruction to have you twist your hand to the position of the
    stick which is easier to grab. The corticobulbar tract also runs
    through the cerebral peduncles. The corticobulbar tract connects the
    cerebral cortex and the brain stem and consists of motor neurons of
    some cranial nerves. Therefore, the corticobulbar tract controls
    muscles of the face, head, and neck.
