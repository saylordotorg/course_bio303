**Unit 3: Synapses and Neurotransmitters** <span id="3"></span> 
*Returning to our example of heat sensation and the reflexes it elicits,
we will now look at synapses and neurotransmitters. Synapses are the
communication links between neurons or between neurons and other cells.
The human brain alone contains more than 100 billion neurons, and each
of those neurons contains numerous synapses, multiplying to a
mind-boggling number of neural connections. This unit will first examine
the two major types of synapses: electrical and chemical. Compared to
electrical synapses, chemical synapses are slower, more varied, and
offer signal amplification. We will also learn that, because most
neurons have a number of synapses, there are also regulatory pathways
that prevent signaling confusion. Lastly, we will cover
neurotransmitters, agents produced by the presynaptic cell that initiate
actions for the postsynaptic cell.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 9.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.3: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.4: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.5: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.6: 2 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   list the steps of an impulse being transmitted across the synaptic
    cleft;
-   compare and contrast chemical and electrical synapses;
-   define inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and
    demonstrate an understanding of the definition of summation of
    potentials;
-   identify the different neurotransmitter categories, and explain the
    unique properties of the different categories; and
-   compare and contrast the ionotropic and metabotropic receptor
    families.
