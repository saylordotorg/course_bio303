**Unit 7: Somatic Sensory System** <span id="7"></span> 
*We will now begin looking at global neural systems. We will begin with
the somatic sensory system, which detects physical stimuli such as
pressure, temperature, and pain. There are two subsystems within the
larger somatic sensory system—one for pressure (mechanosensory) and the
other for temperature (thermoception) and pain (nociception). Between
these systems, we have a number of receptors that will inform us
everything from temperature to muscle stretch. We know a great deal
about how these systems work. For example, our use of menthol and
capsaicin takes advantage of temperature sensation to enable the feeling
of “cool” mints and “spicy” oils. Our somatic sensory is among the
oldest and most primitive of nervous functions, existing even in the
simplest of organisms.*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

    functions;
-   explain how the mechanosensory pathway changes throughout the body,
    the function of dermatomes, and the homunculus; and

     Instructions: Read the entire webpage. Proprioception is the
    ability to know where you are in space. To understand this concept,
    close your eyes and point to your nose with your right index finger.
    You managed to complete this task without looking at your hand
    through the “magic” of proprioception. There are several types of
    receptors that function together to provide your brain with
    proprioception information. You should be able to identify these
    types of receptors and the contributions that each makes.
