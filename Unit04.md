**Unit 4: Neural Plasticity and Repair** <span id="4"></span> 
*Plasticity is the process by which neurons change and connect as a
result of new experiences. It is most evident in infancy and childhood,
where the growing brain will rapidly learn new skills and acquire
knowledge. The adult brain, although less able to adapt, is able to form
new memories throughout its lifetime thanks to plasticity. Neural repair
reshapes connections, though this process is much more varied.
Researchers continue to deepen their appreciation for the importance of
plasticity in adults as they seek clues as to how the brain and spinal
cord recover from injury. This unit will study plasticity in growing and
injured neurons and discuss the leading theories explaining how neurons
adapt.*

     Instructions: Read the sections titled “Proteolytic Mechanisms of
    Cell Death” and “Secondary Injury.” Apoptosis is cell suicide, where
    as necrosis is unintentional cell death. Necrosis activates major
    inflammatory pathways and results in a host of other problems that
    apoptosis does not incur. Be sure to understand how and why one
    occurs and not the other.
