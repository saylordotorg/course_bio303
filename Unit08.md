**Unit 8: Special Senses** <span id="8"></span> 
*This unit will cover all of our special senses. While you may know the
four common ones (sight, smell, taste, hearing), you may not be familiar
with the vestibular sense, which helps us orient ourselves in terms of
head position, motion, and spatial awareness. Each of these senses has
its own unique anatomy as well as system of detecting stimuli, and each
sense projects to different parts of the brain. Because we depend on
these senses for everyday function, they have sophisticated and complex
mechanisms of action.  *

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 18 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.2: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.3: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.4: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.5: 4 hours

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   identify the parts of the eye, define how eyes perceive visual
    signals, and the neuronal pathways that function to process visual
    information;
-   identify the parts of the outer, middle, and inner ear;
-   define how ears perceive auditory signals and the neuronal pathways
    that function to process auditory information;
-   identify the parts of the vestibular system and how this system
    functions in balance;
-   identify the parts of the olfactory system;
-   define how the olfactory system perceives smell, and define the
    neuronal pathways that function to process olfactory information;
-   identify the parts of the gustatory system; and
-   define how the gustatory system perceives tastes, and define the
    neuronal pathways that function to process taste information.
