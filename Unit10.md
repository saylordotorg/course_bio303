**Unit 10: Cortical Brain Functions** <span id="10"></span> 
*The ability to talk, learn, and show emotion are among the most
fundamental and intriguing functions of the human brain. This unit will
provide an overview of these essential functions, known as “cortical
brain functions” despite the fact that are quite complex and involve
more than just the brain.*  
  
 *Much of our information about cortical brain function has been derived
from examining the symptoms and profiles of patients with damage to
specific regions of the brain. Recently, the development of noninvasive
procedures has enabled us to examine subjects to further understand
neurological mechanisms and thus led to the establishment of a
sub-neuroscience field known as cognitive neuroscience. Researchers in
this subfield strive to elucidate the molecular and physiological basis
for these functions.*

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**

**Unit10 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   explain the different cortical cell types and how the Brodman’s
    areas define functional regions of the cortex;
-   define the association cortices and their major functions;
-   explain contralateral neglect syndrome;
-   define the cortical regions which process speech and language and
    the meaning of aphasias;
-   explain how the brain regulates sleep, including the changes during
    sleep, stages of sleep, and how the circadian rhythm controls sleep;
-   list some drugs used for sleep disorders, and explain narcolepsy and
    insomnia;
-   define how the limbic system, especially the amygdale regulates
    emotions;
-   define the parts of the nervous system which control memory;
-   compare and contrast the different kinds of memory, including
    declarative and nondeclarative, immediate, short-term, and long-term
    memory; and
-   explain how Alzheimer’s Disease leads to memory loss.
