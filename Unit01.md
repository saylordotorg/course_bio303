**Unit 1: Basic Concepts and Introduction** <span id="1"></span> 
**In our first unit of neurobiology, we will review some of the
fundamental concepts of chemistry and biology that you will need to know
prior to learning new material in this course. This unit will also
introduce to you the general anatomy and function of neurobiology, from
the individual neurons to global control systems. This introduction is
designed to help you keep track of how individual topics you will learn
about in this course relate to the larger picture. **

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 6 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.3: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.4: 2 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   compare and contrast types of chemical bonds;
-   know and define the steps of the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology;
-   identify the basic cell types in the nervous system, and explain the
    basic cellular structure of neurons;
-   define “afferent” and “efferent” neurons and the basic steps of a
    simple reflex circuit;
-   compare and contrast the Central Nervous System and the Peripheral
    Nervous System; and
-   identify the five sensory organs of the human body.

     Instructions: Click on “Chemistry” on the right margin, then click
    on the bubble for “Chemical Bonding,” and select any bubble for the
    chemical bond shown on the webpage to read about it. While this
    course is not a chemistry course, it is important to understand
    basic chemistry principles, such as chemical bonds and ionic
    charges, in order to learn neurobiology concepts, such as action
    potential and neurotransmission.

    you can get different answers if you are upside down or upright. To
    eliminate ambiguity in phrasing, biologists have developed
    specialized terms (i.e. superior and anterior) to help you
    accurately define the location of body parts in relation to one
    another. It is very important that you know these terms so that you
    will be able to trace paths or learning positions more easily.
